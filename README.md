## Purpose of the Application
MovieTracker is a web application that allows users to:
- Track the movies they have watched
- Upload new movie entries
- Visualise statistics of different genres
- Share their movie reviews with other users
- Sign up and sign in securely

The design follows a simple and intuitive user interface inspired by platforms like IMDb, built with Flask, Bootstrap, and SQLite, using AJAX for dynamic updates.
